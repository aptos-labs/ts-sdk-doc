# TS SDK Docs

These docs support the [aptos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aptos) NPM package, and those looking to use it should reconsider and use the newer [@aptos-labs/ts-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aptos-labs/ts-sdk) package instead.

This page is no longer being updated, and is just here for reference.
